# Advent of Code

This repo contains the solutions for the problems of the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com).

So far, I'm solving the problems using the following languages:

- Go
- Elixir

The next I plan:

- Rust
- Haskell

The ideia of this repo is use the problems to practice some new languagens that I've been learning.
